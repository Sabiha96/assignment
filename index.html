                outskirts of
                Mexico City.[134][135] Kahlo stated that she was born at the family home, La Casa Azul (The Blue House),
                but
                according to the official birth registry, the birth took place at the nearby home of her maternal

                came out stronger.
                She never stayed silent, she never worried that her strength or power or success might intimidate others
                nor she
                was demure. Frida never apologized for her strength, her art, her politics, or her sexuality, and she
                did not
                need to. <br>She simply was who she was.</p>
